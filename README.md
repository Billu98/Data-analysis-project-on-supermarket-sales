# Exploratory Data Analysis with Python and Pandas

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Exploratory Data Analysis project, focusing on Supermarket sales. The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize key trends and patterns in the Supermarket sales dataset obtained from Kaggle.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Supermarket sales dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle (Link to dataset: [Supermarket Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales))
- **Description:** The dataset includes information about supermarket sales, covering various aspects such as product details, customer demographics, and sales figures.

## Project Structure
- **Jupyter Notebook:** 
  - This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for the exploratory data analysis.
- **Data Folder:** 
  - This folder contains the dataset used for analysis.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`
3. Follow the step-by-step analysis in the notebook.
4. Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt the code to suit your needs.
